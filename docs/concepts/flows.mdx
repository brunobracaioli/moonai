## Introduction

Moonai Flows is a powerful feature designed to streamline the creation and management of AI workflows. Flows allow developers to combine and coordinate coding missions and Squads efficiently, providing a robust framework for building sophisticated AI automations.

Flows allow you to create structured, event-driven workflows. They provide a seamless way to connect multiple missions, manage state, and control the flow of execution in your AI applications. With Flows, you can easily design and implement multi-step processes that leverage the full potential of Moonai's capabilities.

1. **Simplified Workflow Creation**: Easily chain together multiple Squads and missions to create complex AI workflows.

2. **State Management**: Flows make it super easy to manage and share state between different missions in your workflow.

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Built on an event-driven model, allowing for dynamic and responsive workflows.

4. **Flexible Control Flow**: Implement conditional logic, loops, and branching within your workflows.

5. **Input Flexibility**: Flows can accept inputs to initialize or update their state, with different handling for structured and unstructured state management.

## Getting Started

Let's create a simple Flow where you will use OpenAI to generate a random city in one mission and then use that city to generate a fun fact in another mission.

### Passing Inputs to Flows

Flows can accept inputs to initialize or update their state before execution. The way inputs are handled depends on whether the flow uses structured or unstructured state management.

#### Structured State Management

In structured state management, the flow's state is defined using a Pydantic `BaseModel`. Inputs must match the model's schema, and any updates will overwrite the default values.

```python
from moonai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ExampleState(BaseModel):
    counter: int = 0
    message: str = ""

class StructuredExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):
    @start()
    def first_method(self):
        # Implementation

flow = StructuredExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff(inputs={"counter": 10})
```

In this example, the `counter` is initialized to `10`, while `message` retains its default value.

#### Unstructured State Management

In unstructured state management, the flow's state is a dictionary. You can pass any dictionary to update the state.

```python
from moonai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start

class UnstructuredExampleFlow(Flow):
    @start()
    def first_method(self):
        # Implementation

flow = UnstructuredExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff(inputs={"counter": 5, "message": "Initial message"})
```

Here, both `counter` and `message` are updated based on the provided inputs.

**Note:** Ensure that inputs for structured state management adhere to the defined schema to avoid validation errors.

### Example Flow

```python
# Existing example code
```

In the above example, we have created a simple Flow that generates a random city using OpenAI and then generates a fun fact about that city. The Flow consists of two missions: `generate_city` and `generate_fun_fact`. The `generate_city` mission is the starting point of the Flow, and the `generate_fun_fact` mission listens for the output of the `generate_city` mission.

When you run the Flow, it will generate a random city and then generate a fun fact about that city. The output will be printed to the console.

**Note:** Ensure you have set up your `.env` file to store your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. This key is necessary for authenticating requests to the OpenAI API.

### @start()

The `@start()` decorator is used to mark a method as the starting point of a Flow. When a Flow is started, all the methods decorated with `@start()` are executed in parallel. You can have multiple start methods in a Flow, and they will all be executed when the Flow is started.

### @listen()

The `@listen()` decorator is used to mark a method as a listener for the output of another mission in the Flow. The method decorated with `@listen()` will be executed when the specified mission emits an output. The method can access the output of the mission it is listening to as an argument.

#### Usage

The `@listen()` decorator can be used in several ways:

1. **Listening to a Method by Name**: You can pass the name of the method you want to listen to as a string. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.

   ```python
   @listen("generate_city")
   def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):
       # Implementation
   ```

2. **Listening to a Method Directly**: You can pass the method itself. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.
   ```python
   @listen(generate_city)
   def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):
       # Implementation
   ```

### Flow Output

Accessing and handling the output of a Flow is essential for integrating your AI workflows into larger applications or systems. Moonai Flows provide straightforward mechanisms to retrieve the final output, access intermediate results, and manage the overall state of your Flow.

#### Retrieving the Final Output

When you run a Flow, the final output is determined by the last method that completes. The `kickoff()` method returns the output of this final method.

Here's how you can access the final output:

<CodeGroup>
```python
from moonai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start

class OutputExampleFlow(Flow):
    @start()
    def first_method(self):
        return "Output from first_method"

    @listen(first_method)
    def second_method(self, first_output):
        return f"Second method received: {first_output}"

flow = OutputExampleFlow()
final_output = flow.kickoff()

print("---- Final Output ----")
print(final_output)
```

```text
---- Final Output ----
Second method received: Output from first_method
```

</CodeGroup>

In this example, the `second_method` is the last method to complete, so its output will be the final output of the Flow.
The `kickoff()` method will return the final output, which is then printed to the console.

#### Accessing and Updating State

In addition to retrieving the final output, you can also access and update the state within your Flow. The state can be used to store and share data between different methods in the Flow. After the Flow has run, you can access the state to retrieve any information that was added or updated during the execution.

Here's an example of how to update and access the state:

<CodeGroup>

```python
from moonai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ExampleState(BaseModel):
    counter: int = 0
    message: str = ""

class StateExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):

    @start()
    def first_method(self):
        self.state.message = "Hello from first_method"
        self.state.counter += 1

    @listen(first_method)
    def second_method(self):
        self.state.message += " - updated by second_method"
        self.state.counter += 1
        return self.state.message

flow = StateExampleFlow()
final_output = flow.kickoff()
print(f"Final Output: {final_output}")
print("Final State:")
print(flow.state)
```

```text
Final Output: Hello from first_method - updated by second_method
Final State:
counter=2 message='Hello from first_method - updated by second_method'
```

</CodeGroup>

In this example, the state is updated by both `first_method` and `second_method`.
After the Flow has run, you can access the final state to see the updates made by these methods.

By ensuring that the final method's output is returned and providing access to the state, Moonai Flows make it easy to integrate the results of your AI workflows into larger applications or systems,
while also maintaining and accessing the state throughout the Flow's execution.

## Flow State Management

Managing state effectively is crucial for building reliable and maintainable AI workflows. Moonai Flows provides robust mechanisms for both unstructured and structured state management,
allowing developers to choose the approach that best fits their application's needs.

### Unstructured State Management

In unstructured state management, all state is stored in the `state` attribute of the `Flow` class.
This approach offers flexibility, enabling developers to add or modify state attributes on the fly without defining a strict schema.

```python
from moonai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start

class UnstructuredExampleFlow(Flow):

    @start()
    def first_method(self):
        self.state.message = "Hello from structured flow"
        self.state.counter = 0

    @listen(first_method)
    def second_method(self):
        self.state.counter += 1
        self.state.message += " - updated"

    @listen(second_method)
    def third_method(self):
        self.state.counter += 1
        self.state.message += " - updated again"

        print(f"State after third_method: {self.state}")

flow = UnstructuredExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```

**Key Points:**

- **Flexibility:** You can dynamically add attributes to `self.state` without predefined constraints.
- **Simplicity:** Ideal for straightforward workflows where state structure is minimal or varies significantly.

### Structured State Management

Structured state management leverages predefined schemas to ensure consistency and type safety across the workflow.
By using models like Pydantic's `BaseModel`, developers can define the exact shape of the state, enabling better validation and auto-completion in development environments.

```python
from moonai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ExampleState(BaseModel):
    counter: int = 0
    message: str = ""

class StructuredExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):

    @start()
    def first_method(self):
        self.state.message = "Hello from structured flow"

    @listen(first_method)
    def second_method(self):
        self.state.counter += 1
        self.state.message += " - updated"

    @listen(second_method)
    def third_method(self):
        self.state.counter += 1
        self.state.message += " - updated again"

        print(f"State after third_method: {self.state}")

flow = StructuredExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```

**Key Points:**

- **Defined Schema:** `ExampleState` clearly outlines the state structure, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- **Type Safety:** Leveraging Pydantic ensures that state attributes adhere to the specified types, reducing runtime errors.
- **Auto-Completion:** IDEs can provide better auto-completion and error checking based on the defined state model.

### Choosing Between Unstructured and Structured State Management

- **Use Unstructured State Management when:**

  - The workflow's state is simple or highly dynamic.
  - Flexibility is prioritized over strict state definitions.
  - Rapid prototyping is required without the overhead of defining schemas.

- **Use Structured State Management when:**
  - The workflow requires a well-defined and consistent state structure.
  - Type safety and validation are important for your application's reliability.
  - You want to leverage IDE features like auto-completion and type checking for better developer experience.

By providing both unstructured and structured state management options, Moonai Flows empowers developers to build AI workflows that are both flexible and robust, catering to a wide range of application requirements.

## Flow Control

### Conditional Logic: `or`

The `or_` function in Flows allows you to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method when any of the specified methods emit an output.

<CodeGroup>

```python
from moonai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, or_, start

class OrExampleFlow(Flow):

    @start()
    def start_method(self):
        return "Hello from the start method"

    @listen(start_method)
    def second_method(self):
        return "Hello from the second method"

    @listen(or_(start_method, second_method))
    def logger(self, result):
        print(f"Logger: {result}")

flow = OrExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```

```text
Logger: Hello from the start method
Logger: Hello from the second method
```

</CodeGroup>

When you run this Flow, the `logger` method will be triggered by the output of either the `start_method` or the `second_method`.
The `or_` function is used to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method when any of the specified methods emit an output.

### Conditional Logic: `and`

The `and_` function in Flows allows you to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method only when all the specified methods emit an output.

<CodeGroup>

```python
from moonai.flow.flow import Flow, and_, listen, start

class AndExampleFlow(Flow):

    @start()
    def start_method(self):
        self.state["greeting"] = "Hello from the start method"

    @listen(start_method)
    def second_method(self):
        self.state["joke"] = "What do computers eat? Microchips."

    @listen(and_(start_method, second_method))
    def logger(self):
        print("---- Logger ----")
        print(self.state)

flow = AndExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```

```text
---- Logger ----
{'greeting': 'Hello from the start method', 'joke': 'What do computers eat? Microchips.'}
```

</CodeGroup>

When you run this Flow, the `logger` method will be triggered only when both the `start_method` and the `second_method` emit an output.
The `and_` function is used to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method only when all the specified methods emit an output.

### Router

The `@router()` decorator in Flows allows you to define conditional routing logic based on the output of a method.
You can specify different routes based on the output of the method, allowing you to control the flow of execution dynamically.

<CodeGroup>

```python
import random
from moonai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, router, start
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ExampleState(BaseModel):
    success_flag: bool = False

class RouterFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):

    @start()
    def start_method(self):
        print("Starting the structured flow")
        random_boolean = random.choice([True, False])
        self.state.success_flag = random_boolean

    @router(start_method)
    def second_method(self):
        if self.state.success_flag:
            return "success"
        else:
            return "failed"

    @listen("success")
    def third_method(self):
        print("Third method running")

    @listen("failed")
    def fourth_method(self):
        print("Fourth method running")

flow = RouterFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```

```text
Starting the structured flow
Third method running
Fourth method running
```

</CodeGroup>

In the above example, the `start_method` generates a random boolean value and sets it in the state.
The `second_method` uses the `@router()` decorator to define conditional routing logic based on the value of the boolean.
If the boolean is `True`, the method returns `"success"`, and if it is `False`, the method returns `"failed"`.
The `third_method` and `fourth_method` listen to the output of the `second_method` and execute based on the returned value.

When you run this Flow, the output will change based on the random boolean value generated by the `start_method`.

## Adding Squads to Flows

Creating a flow with multiple squads in Moonai is straightforward.

You can generate a new Moonai project that includes all the scaffolding needed to create a flow with multiple squads by running the following command:

```bash
moonai create flow name_of_flow
```

This command will generate a new Moonai project with the necessary folder structure. The generated project includes a prebuilt squad called `poem_squad` that is already working. You can use this squad as a template by copying, pasting, and editing it to create other squads.

### Folder Structure

After running the `moonai create flow name_of_flow` command, you will see a folder structure similar to the following:

| Directory/File         | Description                                                        |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name_of_flow/`        | Root directory for the flow.                                       |
| ├── `squads/`           | Contains directories for specific squads.                           |
| │ └── `poem_squad/`     | Directory for the "poem_squad" with its configurations and scripts. |
| │ ├── `config/`        | Configuration files directory for the "poem_squad".                 |
| │ │ ├── `agents.yaml`  | YAML file defining the agents for "poem_squad".                     |
| │ │ └── `missions.yaml`   | YAML file defining the missions for "poem_squad".                      |
| │ ├── `poem_squad.py`   | Script for "poem_squad" functionality.                              |
| ├── `tools/`           | Directory for additional tools used in the flow.                   |
| │ └── `custom_tool.py` | Custom tool implementation.                                        |
| ├── `main.py`          | Main script for running the flow.                                  |
| ├── `README.md`        | Project description and instructions.                              |
| ├── `pyproject.toml`   | Configuration file for project dependencies and settings.          |
| └── `.gitignore`       | Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control.      |

### Building Your Squads

In the `squads` folder, you can define multiple squads. Each squad will have its own folder containing configuration files and the squad definition file. For example, the `poem_squad` folder contains:

- `config/agents.yaml`: Defines the agents for the squad.
- `config/missions.yaml`: Defines the missions for the squad.
- `poem_squad.py`: Contains the squad definition, including agents, missions, and the squad itself.

You can copy, paste, and edit the `poem_squad` to create other squads.

### Connecting Squads in `main.py`

The `main.py` file is where you create your flow and connect the squads together. You can define your flow by using the `Flow` class and the decorators `@start` and `@listen` to specify the flow of execution.

Here's an example of how you can connect the `poem_squad` in the `main.py` file:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from random import randint

from pydantic import BaseModel
from moonai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from .squads.poem_squad.poem_squad import PoemSquad

class PoemState(BaseModel):
    sentence_count: int = 1
    poem: str = ""

class PoemFlow(Flow[PoemState]):

    @start()
    def generate_sentence_count(self):
        print("Generating sentence count")
        self.state.sentence_count = randint(1, 5)

    @listen(generate_sentence_count)
    def generate_poem(self):
        print("Generating poem")
        result = PoemSquad().squad().kickoff(inputs={"sentence_count": self.state.sentence_count})

        print("Poem generated", result.raw)
        self.state.poem = result.raw

    @listen(generate_poem)
    def save_poem(self):
        print("Saving poem")
        with open("poem.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write(self.state.poem)

def kickoff():
    poem_flow = PoemFlow()
    poem_flow.kickoff()


def plot():
    poem_flow = PoemFlow()
    poem_flow.plot()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    kickoff()
```

In this example, the `PoemFlow` class defines a flow that generates a sentence count, uses the `PoemSquad` to generate a poem, and then saves the poem to a file. The flow is kicked off by calling the `kickoff()` method.

### Running the Flow

(Optional) Before running the flow, you can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
moonai install
```

Once all of the dependencies are installed, you need to activate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

After activating the virtual environment, you can run the flow by executing one of the following commands:

```bash
moonai flow kickoff
```

or

```bash
uv run kickoff
```

The flow will execute, and you should see the output in the console.


### Adding Additional Squads Using the CLI

Once you have created your initial flow, you can easily add additional squads to your project using the CLI. This allows you to expand your flow's capabilities by integrating new squads without starting from scratch.

To add a new squad to your existing flow, use the following command:

```bash
moonai flow add-squad <squad_name>
```

This command will create a new directory for your squad within the `squads` folder of your flow project. It will include the necessary configuration files and a squad definition file, similar to the initial setup.

#### Folder Structure

After adding a new squad, your folder structure will look like this:

| Directory/File         | Description                                                        |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name_of_flow/`        | Root directory for the flow.                                       |
| ├── `squads/`           | Contains directories for specific squads.                           |
| │   ├── `poem_squad/`   | Directory for the "poem_squad" with its configurations and scripts. |
| │   │   ├── `config/`  | Configuration files directory for the "poem_squad".                 |
| │   │   │  ├── `agents.yaml` | YAML file defining the agents for "poem_squad".                     |
| │   │   │  └── `missions.yaml`  | YAML file defining the missions for "poem_squad".                      |
| │   │   └── `poem_squad.py`    | Script for "poem_squad" functionality.                              |
| └── `name_of_squad/`       | Directory for the new squad.                                          |
|     ├── `config/`         | Configuration files directory for the new squad.                     |
|     │   ├── `agents.yaml` | YAML file defining the agents for the new squad.                     |
|     │   └── `missions.yaml`  | YAML file defining the missions for the new squad.                      |
|     └── `name_of_squad.py` | Script for the new squad functionality.                              |

You can then customize the `agents.yaml` and `missions.yaml` files to define the agents and missions for your new squad. The `name_of_squad.py` file will contain the squad's logic, which you can modify to suit your needs.

By using the CLI to add additional squads, you can efficiently build complex AI workflows that leverage multiple squads working together.

## Plot Flows

Visualizing your AI workflows can provide valuable insights into the structure and execution paths of your flows. Moonai offers a powerful visualization tool that allows you to generate interactive plots of your flows, making it easier to understand and optimize your AI workflows.

### What are Plots?

Plots in Moonai are graphical representations of your AI workflows. They display the various missions, their connections, and the flow of data between them. This visualization helps in understanding the sequence of operations, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring that the workflow logic aligns with your expectations.

### How to Generate a Plot

Moonai provides two convenient methods to generate plots of your flows:

#### Option 1: Using the `plot()` Method

If you are working directly with a flow instance, you can generate a plot by calling the `plot()` method on your flow object. This method will create an HTML file containing the interactive plot of your flow.

```python
# Assuming you have a flow instance
flow.plot("my_flow_plot")
```

This will generate a file named `my_flow_plot.html` in your current directory. You can open this file in a web browser to view the interactive plot.

#### Option 2: Using the Command Line

If you are working within a structured Moonai project, you can generate a plot using the command line. This is particularly useful for larger projects where you want to visualize the entire flow setup.

```bash
moonai flow plot
```

This command will generate an HTML file with the plot of your flow, similar to the `plot()` method. The file will be saved in your project directory, and you can open it in a web browser to explore the flow.

### Understanding the Plot

The generated plot will display nodes representing the missions in your flow, with directed edges indicating the flow of execution. The plot is interactive, allowing you to zoom in and out, and hover over nodes to see additional details.

By visualizing your flows, you can gain a clearer understanding of the workflow's structure, making it easier to debug, optimize, and communicate your AI processes to others.


## Advanced

In this section, we explore more complex use cases of Moonai Flows, starting with a self-evaluation loop. This pattern is crucial for developing AI systems that can iteratively improve their outputs through feedback.

### 1) Self-Evaluation Loop

The self-evaluation loop is a powerful pattern that allows AI workflows to automatically assess and refine their outputs. This example demonstrates how to set up a flow that generates content, evaluates it, and iterates based on feedback until the desired quality is achieved.

#### Overview

The self-evaluation loop involves two main Squads:

1. **ShakespeareanXPostSquad**: Generates a Shakespearean-style post on a given topic.
2. **XPostReviewSquad**: Evaluates the generated post, providing feedback on its validity and quality.

The process iterates until the post meets the criteria or a maximum retry limit is reached. This approach ensures high-quality outputs through iterative refinement.

#### Importance

This pattern is essential for building robust AI systems that can adapt and improve over time. By automating the evaluation and feedback loop, developers can ensure that their AI workflows produce reliable and high-quality results.

#### Main Code Highlights

Below is the `main.py` file for the self-evaluation loop flow:

```python
from typing import Optional
from moonai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, router, start
from pydantic import BaseModel
from self_evaluation_loop_flow.squads.shakespeare_squad.shakespeare_squad import (
    ShakespeareanXPostSquad,
)
from self_evaluation_loop_flow.squads.x_post_review_squad.x_post_review_squad import (
    XPostReviewSquad,
)

class ShakespeareXPostFlowState(BaseModel):
    x_post: str = ""
    feedback: Optional[str] = None
    valid: bool = False
    retry_count: int = 0

class ShakespeareXPostFlow(Flow[ShakespeareXPostFlowState]):

    @start("retry")
    def generate_shakespeare_x_post(self):
        print("Generating Shakespearean X post")
        topic = "Flying cars"
        result = (
            ShakespeareanXPostSquad()
            .squad()
            .kickoff(inputs={"topic": topic, "feedback": self.state.feedback})
        )
        print("X post generated", result.raw)
        self.state.x_post = result.raw

    @router(generate_shakespeare_x_post)
    def evaluate_x_post(self):

#### Code Highlights

- **Retry Mechanism**: The flow uses a retry mechanism to regenerate the post if it doesn't meet the criteria, up to a maximum of three retries.
- **Feedback Loop**: Feedback from the `XPostReviewSquad` is used to refine the post iteratively.
- **State Management**: The flow maintains state using a Pydantic model, ensuring type safety and clarity.

## Next Steps

If you're interested in exploring additional examples of flows, we have a variety of recommendations in our examples repository. Here are five specific flow examples, each showcasing unique use cases to help you match your current problem type to a specific example:

1. **Email Auto Responder Flow**: This example demonstrates an infinite loop where a background job continually runs to automate email responses. It's a great use case for missions that need to be performed repeatedly without manual intervention. [View Example](https://github.com/brunobracaioli/moonai/moonai-examples/tree/main/email_auto_responder_flow)

2. **Lead Score Flow**: This flow showcases adding human-in-the-loop feedback and handling different conditional branches using the router. It's an excellent example of how to incorporate dynamic decision-making and human oversight into your workflows. [View Example](https://github.com/brunobracaioli/moonai/moonai-examples/tree/main/lead-score-flow)

3. **Write a Book Flow**: This example excels at chaining multiple squads together, where the output of one squad is used by another. Specifically, one squad outlines an entire book, and another squad generates chapters based on the outline. Eventually, everything is connected to produce a complete book. This flow is perfect for complex, multi-step processes that require coordination between different missions. [View Example](https://github.com/brunobracaioli/moonai/moonai-examples/tree/main/write_a_book_with_flows)

4. **Meeting Assistant Flow**: This flow demonstrates how to broadcast one event to trigger multiple follow-up actions. For instance, after a meeting is completed, the flow can update a Trello board, send a Slack message, and save the results. It's a great example of handling multiple outcomes from a single event, making it ideal for comprehensive mission management and notification systems. [View Example](https://github.com/brunobracaioli/moonai/moonai-examples/tree/main/meeting_assistant_flow)

5. **Self Evaluation Loop Flow**: This flow demonstrates a self-evaluation loop where AI workflows automatically assess and refine their outputs through feedback. It involves generating content, evaluating it, and iterating until the desired quality is achieved. This pattern is crucial for developing robust AI systems that can adapt and improve over time. [View Example](https://github.com/brunobracaioli/moonai/moonai-examples/tree/main/self_evaluation_loop_flow)

By exploring these examples, you can gain insights into how to leverage Moonai Flows for various use cases, from automating repetitive missions to managing complex, multi-step processes with dynamic decision-making and human feedback.
