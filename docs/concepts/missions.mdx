## Overview of a Mission

In the Moonai framework, a `Mission` is a specific assignment completed by an `Agent`. 

They provide all necessary details for execution, such as a description, the agent responsible, required tools, and more, facilitating a wide range of action complexities.


missions within Moonai can be collaborative, requiring multiple agents to work together. This is managed through the mission properties and orchestrated by the Squad's process, enhancing teamwork and efficiency.

## Mission Attributes

## Creating a Mission

Creating a mission involves defining its scope, responsible agent, and any additional attributes for flexibility:

```python Code
from moonai import Mission

mission = Mission(
    description='Find and summarize the latest and most relevant news on AI',
    agent=sales_agent,
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
)
```

<Tip>
  Directly specify an `agent` for assignment or let the `hierarchical` Moonai's process decide based on roles, availability, etc.
</Tip>

## Mission Output

The output of a mission in Moonai framework is encapsulated within the `MissionOutput` class. This class provides a structured way to access results of a mission, including various formats such as raw output, JSON, and Pydantic models.

By default, the `MissionOutput` will only include the `raw` output. A `MissionOutput` will only include the `pydantic` or `json_dict` output if the original `Mission` object was configured with `output_pydantic` or `output_json`, respectively.

### Mission Output Attributes

| Attribute         | Parameters      | Type                       | Description                                                                                        |
| :---------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description**   | `description`   | `str`                      | Description of the mission.                                                                           |
| **Summary**       | `summary`       | `Optional[str]`            | Summary of the mission, auto-generated from the first 10 words of the description.                    |
| **Raw**           | `raw`           | `str`                      | The raw output of the mission. This is the default format for the output.                             |
| **Pydantic**      | `pydantic`      | `Optional[BaseModel]`      | A Pydantic model object representing the structured output of the mission.                            |
| **JSON Dict**     | `json_dict`     | `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` | A dictionary representing the JSON output of the mission.                                             |
| **Agent**         | `agent`         | `str`                      | The agent that executed the mission.                                                                  |
| **Output Format** | `output_format` | `OutputFormat`             | The format of the mission output, with options including RAW, JSON, and Pydantic. The default is RAW. |

### Mission Methods and Properties

| Method/Property | Description                                                                                       |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **json**        | Returns the JSON string representation of the mission output if the output format is JSON.           |
| **to_dict**     | Converts the JSON and Pydantic outputs to a dictionary.                                           |
| **str**         | Returns the string representation of the mission output, prioritizing Pydantic, then JSON, then raw. |

### Accessing Mission Outputs

Once a mission has been executed, its output can be accessed through the `output` attribute of the `Mission` object. The `MissionOutput` class provides various ways to interact with and present this output.

#### Example

```python Code
# Example mission
mission = Mission(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

# Execute the squad
squad = Squad(
    agents=[research_agent],
    missions=[mission],
    verbose=True
)

result = squad.kickoff()

# Accessing the mission output
mission_output = mission.output

print(f"Mission Description: {mission_output.description}")
print(f"Mission Summary: {mission_output.summary}")
print(f"Raw Output: {mission_output.raw}")
if mission_output.json_dict:
    print(f"JSON Output: {json.dumps(mission_output.json_dict, indent=2)}")
if mission_output.pydantic:
    print(f"Pydantic Output: {mission_output.pydantic}")
```

## Integrating Tools with missions

Leverage tools from the [Moonai Toolkit](https://github.com/brunobracaioli/moonai_tools) and [LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools) for enhanced mission performance and agent interaction.

## Creating a Mission with Tools

```python Code
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key" # serper.dev API key

from moonai import Agent, Mission, Squad
from moonai.moonai_tools import SerperDevTool

research_agent = Agent(
  role='Researcher',
  goal='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
  backstory="""You're a researcher at a large company.
  You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
  to the business.""",
  verbose=True
)

# to perform a semantic search for a specified query from a text's content across the internet
search_tool = SerperDevTool()

mission = Mission(
  description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
  expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
  agent=research_agent,
  tools=[search_tool]
)

squad = Squad(
    agents=[research_agent],
    missions=[mission],
    verbose=True
)

result = squad.kickoff()
print(result)
```

This demonstrates how missions with specific tools can override an agent's default set for tailored mission execution.

## Referring to Other missions

In Moonai, the output of one mission is automatically relayed into the next one, but you can specifically define what missions' output, including multiple, should be used as context for another mission.

This is useful when you have a mission that depends on the output of another mission that is not performed immediately after it. This is done through the `context` attribute of the mission:

```python Code
# ...

research_ai_mission = Mission(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    async_execution=True,
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

research_ops_mission = Mission(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI Ops news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI Ops news',
    async_execution=True,
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

write_blog_mission = Mission(
    description="Write a full blog post about the importance of AI and its latest news",
    expected_output='Full blog post that is 4 paragraphs long',
    agent=writer_agent,
    context=[research_ai_mission, research_ops_mission]
)

#...
```

## Asynchronous Execution

You can define a mission to be executed asynchronously. This means that the squad will not wait for it to be completed to continue with the next mission. This is useful for missions that take a long time to be completed, or that are not crucial for the next missions to be performed.

You can then use the `context` attribute to define in a future mission that it should wait for the output of the asynchronous mission to be completed.

```python Code
#...

list_ideas = Mission(
    description="List of 5 interesting ideas to explore for an article about AI.",
    expected_output="Bullet point list of 5 ideas for an article.",
    agent=researcher,
    async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

list_important_history = Mission(
    description="Research the history of AI and give me the 5 most important events.",
    expected_output="Bullet point list of 5 important events.",
    agent=researcher,
    async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

write_article = Mission(
    description="Write an article about AI, its history, and interesting ideas.",
    expected_output="A 4 paragraph article about AI.",
    agent=writer,
    context=[list_ideas, list_important_history] # Will wait for the output of the two missions to be completed
)

#...
```

## Callback Mechanism

The callback function is executed after the mission is completed, allowing for actions or notifications to be triggered based on the mission's outcome.

```python Code
# ...

def callback_function(output: MissionOutput):
    # Do something after the mission is completed
    # Example: Send an email to the manager
    print(f"""
        Mission completed!
        Mission: {output.description}
        Output: {output.raw}
    """)

research_mission = Mission(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool],
    callback=callback_function
)

#...
```

## Accessing a Specific Mission Output

Once a squad finishes running, you can access the output of a specific mission by using the `output` attribute of the mission object:

```python Code
# ...
mission1 = Mission(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

#...

squad = Squad(
    agents=[research_agent],
    missions=[mission1, mission2, mission3],
    verbose=True
)

result = squad.kickoff()

# Returns a MissionOutput object with the description and results of the mission
print(f"""
    Mission completed!
    Mission: {mission1.output.description}
    Output: {mission1.output.raw}
""")
```

## Tool Override Mechanism

Specifying tools in a mission allows for dynamic adaptation of agent capabilities, emphasizing Moonai's flexibility.

## Error Handling and Validation Mechanisms

While creating and executing missions, certain validation mechanisms are in place to ensure the robustness and reliability of mission attributes. These include but are not limited to:

- Ensuring only one output type is set per mission to maintain clear output expectations.
- Preventing the manual assignment of the `id` attribute to uphold the integrity of the unique identifier system.

These validations help in maintaining the consistency and reliability of mission executions within the moonai framework.

## Creating Directories when Saving Files

You can now specify if a mission should create directories when saving its output to a file. This is particularly useful for organizing outputs and ensuring that file paths are correctly structured.

```python Code
# ...

save_output_mission = Mission(
    description='Save the summarized AI news to a file',
    expected_output='File saved successfully',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[file_save_tool],
    output_file='outputs/ai_news_summary.txt',
    create_directory=True
)

#...
```

## Conclusion

missions are the driving force behind the actions of agents in Moonai. 
By properly defining missions and their outcomes, you set the stage for your AI agents to work effectively, either independently or as a collaborative unit. 
Equipping missions with appropriate tools, understanding the execution process, and following robust validation practices are crucial for maximizing Moonai's potential, 
ensuring agents are effectively prepared for their assignments and that missions are executed as intended.
