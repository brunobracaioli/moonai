## Understanding Processes
<Tip>
  Processes orchestrate the execution of missions by agents, akin to project management in human teams. 
  These processes ensure missions are distributed and executed efficiently, in alignment with a predefined strategy.
</Tip>

## Process Implementations

- **Sequential**: Executes missions sequentially, ensuring missions are completed in an orderly progression.
- **Hierarchical**: Organizes missions in a managerial hierarchy, where missions are delegated and executed based on a structured chain of command. A manager language model (`manager_llm`) or a custom manager agent (`manager_agent`) must be specified in the squad to enable the hierarchical process, facilitating the creation and management of missions by the manager.
- **Consensual Process (Planned)**: Aiming for collaborative decision-making among agents on mission execution, this process type introduces a democratic approach to mission management within Moonai. It is planned for future development and is not currently implemented in the codebase.

## The Role of Processes in Teamwork
Processes enable individual agents to operate as a cohesive unit, streamlining their efforts to achieve common objectives with efficiency and coherence.

## Assigning Processes to a Squad
To assign a process to a squad, specify the process type upon squad creation to set the execution strategy. For a hierarchical process, ensure to define `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` for the manager agent.

```python
from moonai import Squad
from moonai.process import Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Example: Creating a squad with a sequential process
squad = Squad(
    agents=my_agents,
    missions=my_missions,
    process=Process.sequential
)

# Example: Creating a squad with a hierarchical process
# Ensure to provide a manager_llm or manager_agent
squad = Squad(
    agents=my_agents,
    missions=my_missions,
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
    # or
    # manager_agent=my_manager_agent
)
```
**Note:** Ensure `my_agents` and `my_missions` are defined prior to creating a `Squad` object, and for the hierarchical process, either `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` is also required.

## Sequential Process

This method mirrors dynamic team workflows, progressing through missions in a thoughtful and systematic manner. Mission execution follows the predefined order in the mission list, with the output of one mission serving as context for the next.

To customize mission context, utilize the `context` parameter in the `Mission` class to specify outputs that should be used as context for subsequent missions.

## Hierarchical Process

Emulates a corporate hierarchy, Moonai allows specifying a custom manager agent or automatically creates one, requiring the specification of a manager language model (`manager_llm`). This agent oversees mission execution, including planning, delegation, and validation. missions are not pre-assigned; the manager allocates missions to agents based on their capabilities, reviews outputs, and assesses mission completion.

## Process Class: Detailed Overview

The `Process` class is implemented as an enumeration (`Enum`), ensuring type safety and restricting process values to the defined types (`sequential`, `hierarchical`). The consensual process is planned for future inclusion, emphasizing our commitment to continuous development and innovation.

## Conclusion

The structured collaboration facilitated by processes within Moonai is crucial for enabling systematic teamwork among agents.
