## What is a Squad?

A squad in Moon AI represents a collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of missions. Each squad defines the strategy for mission execution, agent collaboration, and the overall workflow.

## Squad Attributes

| Attribute                             | Parameters             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

<Tip>
**Squad Max RPM**: The `max_rpm` attribute sets the maximum number of requests per minute the squad can perform to avoid rate limits and will override individual agents' `max_rpm` settings if you set it.
</Tip>


## Squad Output

The output of a squad in the Moon AI framework is encapsulated within the `SquadOutput` class.
This class provides a structured way to access results of the squad's execution, including various formats such as raw strings, JSON, and Pydantic models.
The `SquadOutput` includes the results from the final mission output, token usage, and individual mission outputs.

### Squad Output Attributes

| Attribute        | Parameters     | Type                       | Description                                                                                          |
| :--------------- | :------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Raw**          | `raw`          | `str`                      | The raw output of the squad. This is the default format for the output.                               |
| **Pydantic**     | `pydantic`     | `Optional[BaseModel]`      | A Pydantic model object representing the structured output of the squad.                              |
| **JSON Dict**    | `json_dict`    | `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` | A dictionary representing the JSON output of the squad.                                               |
| **missions Output** | `missions_output` | `List[MissionOutput]`         | A list of `MissionOutput` objects, each representing the output of a mission in the squad.                  |
| **Token Usage**  | `token_usage`  | `Dict[str, Any]`           | A summary of token usage, providing insights into the language model's performance during execution. |

### Squad Output Methods and Properties

| Method/Property | Description                                                                                       |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **json**        | Returns the JSON string representation of the squad output if the output format is JSON.           |
| **to_dict**     | Converts the JSON and Pydantic outputs to a dictionary.                                           |
| \***\*str\*\*** | Returns the string representation of the squad output, prioritizing Pydantic, then JSON, then raw. |

### Accessing Squad Outputs

Once a squad has been executed, its output can be accessed through the `output` attribute of the `Squad` object. The `SquadOutput` class provides various ways to interact with and present this output.

#### Example

```python Code
# Example squad execution
squad = Squad(
    agents=[research_agent, writer_agent],
    missions=[research_mission, write_article_mission],
    verbose=True
)

squad_output = squad.kickoff()

# Accessing the squad output
print(f"Raw Output: {squad_output.raw}")
if squad_output.json_dict:
    print(f"JSON Output: {json.dumps(squad_output.json_dict, indent=2)}")
if squad_output.pydantic:
    print(f"Pydantic Output: {squad_output.pydantic}")
print(f"missions Output: {squad_output.missions_output}")
print(f"Token Usage: {squad_output.token_usage}")
```

## Memory Utilization

Squads can utilize memory (short-term, long-term, and entity memory) to enhance their execution and learning over time. This feature allows squads to store and recall execution memories, aiding in decision-making and mission execution strategies.

## Cache Utilization

Caches can be employed to store the results of tools' execution, making the process more efficient by reducing the need to re-execute identical missions.

## Squad Usage Metrics

After the squad execution, you can access the `usage_metrics` attribute to view the language model (LLM) usage metrics for all missions executed by the squad. This provides insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement.

```python Code
# Access the squad's usage metrics
squad = Squad(agents=[agent1, agent2], missions=[mission1, mission2])
squad.kickoff()
print(squad.usage_metrics)
```

## Squad Execution Process

- **Sequential Process**: missions are executed one after another, allowing for a linear flow of work.
- **Hierarchical Process**: A manager agent coordinates the squad, delegating missions and validating outcomes before proceeding. **Note**: A `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` is required for this process and it's essential for validating the process flow.

### Kicking Off a Squad

Once your squad is assembled, initiate the workflow with the `kickoff()` method. This starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.

```python Code
# Start the squad's mission execution
result = my_squad.kickoff()
print(result)
```

### Different Ways to Kick Off a Squad

Once your squad is assembled, initiate the workflow with the appropriate kickoff method. Moon AI provides several methods for better control over the kickoff process: `kickoff()`, `kickoff_for_each()`, `kickoff_async()`, and `kickoff_for_each_async()`.

- `kickoff()`: Starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.
- `kickoff_for_each()`: Executes missions for each agent individually.
- `kickoff_async()`: Initiates the workflow asynchronously.
- `kickoff_for_each_async()`: Executes missions for each agent individually in an asynchronous manner.

```python Code
# Start the squad's mission execution
result = my_squad.kickoff()
print(result)

# Example of using kickoff_for_each
inputs_array = [{'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}, {'topic': 'AI in finance'}]
results = my_squad.kickoff_for_each(inputs=inputs_array)
for result in results:
    print(result)

# Example of using kickoff_async
inputs = {'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}
async_result = my_squad.kickoff_async(inputs=inputs)
print(async_result)

# Example of using kickoff_for_each_async
inputs_array = [{'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}, {'topic': 'AI in finance'}]
async_results = my_squad.kickoff_for_each_async(inputs=inputs_array)
for async_result in async_results:
    print(async_result)
```

These methods provide flexibility in how you manage and execute missions within your squad, allowing for both synchronous and asynchronous workflows tailored to your needs.

### Replaying from a Specific Mission

You can now replay from a specific mission using our CLI command `replay`.

The replay feature in Moon AI allows you to replay from a specific mission using the command-line interface (CLI). By running the command `Moon AI replay -t <mission_id>`, you can specify the `mission_id` for the replay process.

Kickoffs will now save the latest kickoffs returned mission outputs locally for you to be able to replay from.

### Replaying from a Specific Mission Using the CLI

To use the replay feature, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your Moon AI project is located.
3. Run the following command:

To view the latest kickoff mission IDs, use:

```shell
Moon AI log-missions-outputs
```

Then, to replay from a specific mission, use:

```shell
Moon AI replay -t <mission_id>
```

These commands let you replay from your latest kickoff missions, still retaining context from previously executed missions.
