## Introduction

Testing is a crucial part of the development process, and it is essential to ensure that your squad is performing as expected. With moonai, you can easily test your squad and evaluate its performance using the built-in testing capabilities.

### Using the Testing Feature

We added the CLI command `moonai test` to make it easy to test your squad. This command will run your squad for a specified number of iterations and provide detailed performance metrics. The parameters are `n_iterations` and `model`, which are optional and default to 2 and `gpt-4o-mini` respectively. For now, the only provider available is OpenAI.

```bash
moonai test
```

If you want to run more iterations or use a different model, you can specify the parameters like this:

```bash
moonai test --n_iterations 5 --model gpt-4o
```

or using the short forms:

```bash
moonai test -n 5 -m gpt-4o
```

When you run the `moonai test` command, the squad will be executed for the specified number of iterations, and the performance metrics will be displayed at the end of the run.

A table of scores at the end will show the performance of the squad in terms of the following metrics:

<center>**missions Scores (1-10 Higher is better)**</center>

| missions/Squad/Agents  | Run 1 | Run 2 | Avg. Total | Agents                         | Additional Info                  |
|:------------------|:-----:|:-----:|:----------:|:------------------------------:|:---------------------------------|
| Mission 1        |  9.0  |  9.5  |    **9.2**     | Professional Insights          |                                  |
|                    |       |       |            | Researcher                     |                                  |
| Mission 2        |  9.0  | 10.0  |    **9.5**     | Company Profile Investigator   |                                  |
| Mission 3        |  9.0  |  9.0  |    **9.0**     | Automation Insights            |                                  |
|                    |       |       |            | Specialist                     |                                  |
| Mission 4        |  9.0  |  9.0  |    **9.0**     | Final Report Compiler          | Automation Insights Specialist   |
| Squad         | 9.00  | 9.38  |    **9.2**     |                                |                                  |
| Execution Time (s) |  126  |  145  |    **135**     |                                |                                  |

The example above shows the test results for two runs of the squad with two missions, with the average total score for each mission and the squad as a whole.
