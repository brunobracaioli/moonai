title: Before and After Kickoff Hooks
description: Learn how to use before and after kickoff hooks in Moonai
---

Moonai provides hooks that allow you to execute code before and after a squad's kickoff. These hooks are useful for preprocessing inputs or post-processing results.

## Before Kickoff Hook

The before kickoff hook is executed before the squad starts its missions. It receives the input dictionary and can modify it before passing it to the squad. You can use this hook to set up your environment, load necessary data, or preprocess your inputs. This is useful in scenarios where the input data might need enrichment or validation before being processed by the squad.

Here's an example of defining a before kickoff function in your `squad.py`:

```python
from moonai import SquadBase, before_kickoff

@SquadBase
class MySquad:
    @before_kickoff
    def prepare_data(self, inputs):
        # Preprocess or modify inputs
        inputs['processed'] = True
        return inputs

#...
```

In this example, the prepare_data function modifies the inputs by adding a new key-value pair indicating that the inputs have been processed.

## After Kickoff Hook

The after kickoff hook is executed after the squad has completed its missions. It receives the result object, which contains the outputs of the squad's execution. This hook is ideal for post-processing results, such as logging, data transformation, or further analysis.

Here's how you can define an after kickoff function in your `squad.py`:

```python
from moonai import SquadBase, after_kickoff

@SquadBase
class MySquad:
    @after_kickoff
    def log_results(self, result):
        # Log or modify the results
        print("Squad execution completed with result:", result)
        return result

# ...
```


In the `log_results` function, the results of the squad execution are simply printed out. You can extend this to perform more complex operations such as sending notifications or integrating with other services.

## Utilizing Both Hooks

Both hooks can be used together to provide a comprehensive setup and teardown process for your squad's execution. They are particularly useful in maintaining clean code architecture by separating concerns and enhancing the modularity of your Moonai implementations.

## Conclusion

Before and after kickoff hooks in Moonai offer powerful ways to interact with the lifecycle of a squad's execution. By understanding and utilizing these hooks, you can greatly enhance the robustness and flexibility of your AI agents.
