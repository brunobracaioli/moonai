## Introduction

Conditional missions in moonai allow for dynamic workflow adaptation based on the outcomes of previous missions. 
This powerful feature enables squads to make decisions and execute missions selectively, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of your AI-driven processes.

## Example Usage

```python Code
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel
from moonai import Agent, Squad
from moonai.missions.conditional_mission import ConditionalMission
from moonai.missions.mission_output import MissionOutput
from moonai.mission import Mission
from moonai.moonai_tools import SerperDevTool

# Define a condition function for the conditional mission
# If false, the mission will be skipped, if true, then execute the mission.
def is_data_missing(output: MissionOutput) -> bool:
    return len(output.pydantic.events) < 10  # this will skip this mission

# Define the agents
data_fetcher_agent = Agent(
    role="Data Fetcher",
    goal="Fetch data online using Serper tool",
    backstory="Backstory 1",
    verbose=True,
    tools=[SerperDevTool()]
)

data_processor_agent = Agent(
    role="Data Processor",
    goal="Process fetched data",
    backstory="Backstory 2",
    verbose=True
)

summary_generator_agent = Agent(
    role="Summary Generator",
    goal="Generate summary from fetched data",
    backstory="Backstory 3",
    verbose=True
)

class EventOutput(BaseModel):
    events: List[str]

mission1 = Mission(
    description="Fetch data about events in San Francisco using Serper tool",
    expected_output="List of 10 things to do in SF this week",
    agent=data_fetcher_agent,
    output_pydantic=EventOutput,
)

conditional_mission = ConditionalMission(
    description="""
        Check if data is missing. If we have less than 10 events,
        fetch more events using Serper tool so that
        we have a total of 10 events in SF this week..
        """,
    expected_output="List of 10 Things to do in SF this week",
    condition=is_data_missing,
    agent=data_processor_agent,
)

mission3 = Mission(
    description="Generate summary of events in San Francisco from fetched data",
    expected_output="A complete report on the customer and their customers and competitors, including their demographics, preferences, market positioning and audience engagement.",
    agent=summary_generator_agent,
)

# Create a squad with the missions
squad = Squad(
    agents=[data_fetcher_agent, data_processor_agent, summary_generator_agent],
    missions=[mission1, conditional_mission, mission3],
    verbose=True,
    planning=True
)

# Run the squad
result = squad.kickoff()
print("results", result)
