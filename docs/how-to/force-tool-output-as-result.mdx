## Introduction

In Moonai, you can force the output of a tool as the result of an agent's mission. 
This feature is useful when you want to ensure that the tool output is captured and returned as the mission result, avoiding any agent modification during the mission execution.

## Forcing Tool Output as Result

To force the tool output as the result of an agent's mission, you need to set the `result_as_answer` parameter to `True` when adding a tool to the agent. 
This parameter ensures that the tool output is captured and returned as the mission result, without any modifications by the agent.

Here's an example of how to force the tool output as the result of an agent's mission:

```python Code
from moonai.agent import Agent
from my_tool import MyCustomTool

# Create a coding agent with the custom tool
coding_agent = Agent(
        role="Data Scientist",
        goal="Produce amazing reports on AI",
        backstory="You work with data and AI",
        tools=[MyCustomTool(result_as_answer=True)],
    )

# Assuming the tool's execution and result population occurs within the system
mission_result = coding_agent.execute_mission(mission)
```

## Workflow in Action

<Steps>
   <Step title="Mission Execution">
      The agent executes the mission using the tool provided.
   </Step>
   <Step title="Tool Output">
      The tool generates the output, which is captured as the mission result.
   </Step>
   <Step title="Agent Interaction">
      The agent may reflect and take learnings from the tool but the output is not modified.
   </Step>
   <Step title="Result Return">
      The tool output is returned as the mission result without any modifications.
   </Step>
