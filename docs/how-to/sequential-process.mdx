## Introduction

Moonai offers a flexible framework for executing missions in a structured manner, supporting both sequential and hierarchical processes. 
This guide outlines how to effectively implement these processes to ensure efficient mission execution and project completion.

## Sequential Process Overview

The sequential process ensures missions are executed one after the other, following a linear progression. 
This approach is ideal for projects requiring missions to be completed in a specific order.

### Key Features

- **Linear Mission Flow**: Ensures orderly progression by handling missions in a predetermined sequence.
- **Simplicity**: Best suited for projects with clear, step-by-step missions.
- **Easy Monitoring**: Facilitates easy tracking of mission completion and project progress.

## Implementing the Sequential Process

To use the sequential process, assemble your squad and define missions in the order they need to be executed.

```python Code
from moonai import Squad, Process, Agent, Mission, MissionOutput, SquadOutput

# Define your agents
researcher = Agent(
  role='Researcher',
  goal='Conduct foundational research',
  backstory='An experienced researcher with a passion for uncovering insights'
)
analyst = Agent(
  role='Data Analyst',
  goal='Analyze research findings',
  backstory='A meticulous analyst with a knack for uncovering patterns'
)
writer = Agent(
  role='Writer',
  goal='Draft the final report',
  backstory='A skilled writer with a talent for crafting compelling narratives'
)

# Define your missions
research_mission = Mission(
  description='Gather relevant data...', 
  agent=researcher, 
  expected_output='Raw Data'
)
analysis_mission = Mission(
  description='Analyze the data...', 
  agent=analyst, 
  expected_output='Data Insights'
)
writing_mission = Mission(
  description='Compose the report...', 
  agent=writer, 
  expected_output='Final Report'
)

# Form the squad with a sequential process
report_squad = Squad(
  agents=[researcher, analyst, writer],
  missions=[research_mission, analysis_mission, writing_mission],
  process=Process.sequential
)

# Execute the squad
result = report_squad.kickoff()

# Accessing the type-safe output
mission_output: MissionOutput = result.missions[0].output
squad_output: SquadOutput = result.output
```

### Note:

Each mission in a sequential process **must** have an agent assigned. Ensure that every `Mission` includes an `agent` parameter.

### Workflow in Action

1. **Initial Mission**: In a sequential process, the first agent completes their mission and signals completion.
2. **Subsequent missions**: Agents pick up their missions based on the process type, with outcomes of preceding missions or directives guiding their execution.
3. **Completion**: The process concludes once the final mission is executed, leading to project completion.

## Advanced Features

### Mission Delegation

In sequential processes, if an agent has `allow_delegation` set to `True`, they can delegate missions to other agents in the squad. 
This feature is automatically set up when there are multiple agents in the squad.

### Asynchronous Execution

missions can be executed asynchronously, allowing for parallel processing when appropriate. 
To create an asynchronous mission, set `async_execution=True` when defining the mission.

### Memory and Caching

Moonai supports both memory and caching features:

- **Memory**: Enable by setting `memory=True` when creating the Squad. This allows agents to retain information across missions.
- **Caching**: By default, caching is enabled. Set `cache=False` to disable it.

### Callbacks

You can set callbacks at both the mission and step level:

- `mission_callback`: Executed after each mission completion.
- `step_callback`: Executed after each step in an agent's execution.

### Usage Metrics

Moonai tracks token usage across all missions and agents. You can access these metrics after execution.

## Best Practices for Sequential Processes

1. **Order Matters**: Arrange missions in a logical sequence where each mission builds upon the previous one.
2. **Clear Mission Descriptions**: Provide detailed descriptions for each mission to guide the agents effectively.
3. **Appropriate Agent Selection**: Match agents' skills and roles to the requirements of each mission.
4. **Use Context**: Leverage the context from previous missions to inform subsequent ones.
