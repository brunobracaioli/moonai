## Build your first Moonai Agent

Let's create a simple squad that will help us `research` and `report` on the `latest AI developments` for a given topic or subject.

Before we proceed, make sure you have `moonai` installed.
If you haven't installed them yet, you can do so by following the [installation guide](/installation).

Follow the steps below to get squading! üö£‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your squad">
  Create a new squad project by running the following command in your terminal.
  This will create a new directory called `latest-ai-development` with the basic structure for your squad.
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      moonai create squad latest-ai-development
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify your `agents.yaml` file">
  <Tip>
  You can also modify the agents as needed to fit your use case or copy and paste as is to your project.
  Any variable interpolated in your `agents.yaml` and `missions.yaml` files like `{topic}` will be replaced by the value of the variable in the `main.py` file.
  </Tip>
    ```yaml agents.yaml
    # src/latest_ai_development/config/agents.yaml

### Note on Consistency in Naming

The names you use in your YAML files (`agents.yaml` and `missions.yaml`) should match the method names in your Python code.
For example, you can reference the agent for specific missions from `missions.yaml` file.
This naming consistency allows Moonai to automatically link your configurations with your code; otherwise, your mission won't recognize the reference properly.

#### Example References

<Tip>
  Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `agents.yaml` (`email_summarizer`) file as the method name in the `squad.py` (`email_summarizer`) file.
</Tip>

```yaml agents.yaml
email_summarizer:
    role: >
      Email Summarizer
    goal: >
      Summarize emails into a concise and clear summary
    backstory: >
      You will create a 5 bullet point summary of the report
    llm: mixtal_llm
```

<Tip>
  Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `missions.yaml` (`email_summarizer_mission`) file as the method name in the `squad.py` (`email_summarizer_mission`) file.
</Tip>

```yaml missions.yaml
email_summarizer_mission:
    description: >
      Summarize the email into a 5 bullet point summary
    expected_output: >
      A 5 bullet point summary of the email
    agent: email_summarizer
    context:
      - reporting_mission
      - research_mission
```

Use the annotations to properly reference the agent and mission in the `squad.py` file.

### Annotations include:

* `@agent`
* `@mission`
* `@squad`
* `@tool`
* `@before_kickoff`
* `@after_kickoff`
* `@callback`
* `@output_json`
* `@output_pydantic`
* `@cache_handler`

```python squad.py
# ...
@agent
def email_summarizer(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        config=self.agents_config["email_summarizer"],
    )

@mission
def email_summarizer_mission(self) -> Mission:
    return Mission(
        config=self.missions_config["email_summarizer_mission"],
    )
# ...
```

<Tip>
In addition to the [sequential process](../how-to/sequential-process), you can use the [hierarchical process](../how-to/hierarchical-process),
which automatically assigns a manager to the defined squad to properly coordinate the planning and execution of missions through delegation and validation of results.
You can learn more about the core concepts [here](/concepts).
</Tip>

### Replay missions from Latest Squad Kickoff

Moonai now includes a replay feature that allows you to list the missions from the last run and replay from a specific one. To use this feature, run.

```shell
moonai replay <mission_id>
```

Replace `<mission_id>` with the ID of the mission you want to replay.

### Reset Squad Memory

If you need to reset the memory of your squad before running it again, you can do so by calling the reset memory feature:

```shell
moonai reset-memory
```

This will clear the squad's memory, allowing for a fresh start.

## Deploying Your Project

The easiest way to deploy your squad is through [Moonai Enterprise](http://app.moonai.dev/), where you can deploy your squad in a few clicks.
